# LINDI
Language Integrated Dependency Injection ([LINQified][linq] [DI][di])

A language extension that takes advantage of [LINQ][linq] to specify Dependency Resolution and [Inversion of Control][ioc].

This repository's current goal is to be a living document for the potential of such a feature.

# Contributing
## New Features
Our current workflow will rely on [pull requests][pull-request] for fleshing out features for the potential library. Follow these steps:

1. Come up with an idea for a feature
2. Create a markdown document in the `docs/features` folder named after the proposed feature that contains a basic description and usage of the idea
3. Submit a pull request named after the feature that contains a little context on the feature
4. Allow discussion to flesh out the feature and determine its value
5. When a feature is cleared for implementation, it will be merged into [master][master-branch]

## Issues
Submit new issues as needed, reuse non-closed issues if possible.
